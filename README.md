1. OOPS -> Object Oriented Programming System is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.

Example : Car -> a. Manufacturer b. Model c. Year d. Color e. Engine -> Attributes
Behavious : a. Start b. Stop c. Accelerate d. Decelerate e. Turn -> Methods

Class : A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

Everything in C++ inside a class is Private. -> **Default**

Access Modifiers : There are 3 Access Modifiers in C++. that are -> Public, Private, Protected.

Private = Only accessible within the class (Hidden).
Public = Accessible from outside the class.
Protected = Accessible from outside the class but only in derived class.

## Constructors
1. Constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class.
2. Default Constructor : A constructor that doesn't have any parameters is called Default Constructor. -> Automatically generated by the compiler if we don't define any constructor.
Rules :
  - Constructor doesn't have a return type.
  - Constructor name should be same as the class name.
  - Constructor should be public.
